- [Usage](#usage)

## **Setup**

1. First you need to set up the Environment

   - **[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/) in Your Machine**.

     1. Steps are similar like C/C++ but some changes are there also. If you haven't checked out my [C repo](https://github.com/anirban-629/C_Language) check it out and there I've given those similar steps.

     2. If your'e getting stucked into this then just click on the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+configure+jdk) link or search how to configure JDK.

2. I've Used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Code Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/) for writing Code

## **Usage**

There in the code files a lot of problems are solved apart from that every small topic's codes are covered so step by step any one can follow from top to bottom.
